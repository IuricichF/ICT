      Persistent homology is one of the most important tools in computational topology. Using persistent homology, we can extract
      topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions.
      Persistent pairs are detected for identifying relevant features of the underlying space,
      rather than artifacts of sampling, noise, or particular choice of parameters.

      To find the persistent homology of a space, the space must first be represented as a simplicial complex.
      In this section, we are going to introduce the notion of simplicial complex and the notion of simplicial homology,
      a powerful tool for studying topological spaces that will reveal itself as fundamental for understanding
      the information provided by persistent homology.

    <h2 align="left">Simplicial complexes</h2>

      <p>A \(k\)-dimensional <b><em>simplex</em></b> (\(k\)-simplex for short) is the convex hull \(v_0v_1\cdots v_k\) of \(k+1\) affinely independent points \(v_0, v_1, \dots,v_k\) in the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\) which are called its <b><em>vertices</em></b>.
        A <b><em>face</em></b> of \(\sigma=v_0\cdots v_k\) of a non-empty subset of the vertices of \(\sigma\).
      </p>
      <p>

        A <b><em>simplicial complex</em></b> \(\Sigma\) is a finite collection of simplices such that:
        <ul>
          <li>every face of a simplex in \(\Sigma\) is still
          part of \(\Sigma\), and</li>
          <li>the intersection of any two simplices is either empty or a face of both.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A \(d\)-dimensional complex (\(d\)-complex) is a complex such that the maximum of the dimensions of its simplices is \(d\).

        We denote by \(\Sigma_k\) the set of all the \(k\)-simplices in \(\Sigma\).</p>

        <div class="lClass">
          The interactive example illustrates a simplicial complex composed by:
          <ul>
            <li> the 0-simplices in \(\Sigma_0\) <a onmouseover="overFunction(0)" onmouseout="overFunction(-1)"><font color="002db3">(also called vertices)</font></a>,</li>
            <li> the 1-simplices in \(\Sigma_1\) <a onmouseover="overFunction(1)" onmouseout="overFunction(-1)"><font color="006600">(also called edges)</font></a>, and </li>
            <li> the 2-simplices in \(\Sigma_2\) <a onmouseover="overFunction(2)" onmouseout="overFunction(-1)"><font color="b30000">(also called triangles)</font></a>. </li>
          </ul>

          Since the maximum dimension of its simplices is 2, the complex is a simplicial 2-complex. Looking at the only triangle in the complex, we see that its
          <a onmouseover="overFunction(3)" onmouseout="overFunction(-1)"><font color="006600"><b>faces</b></font></a> are its three delimiting edges and their boundary vertices.
          In a similar fashion, the <a onmouseover="overFunction(4)" onmouseout="overFunction(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>faces</b></font></a> of an edge are
          its boundary vertices.

  <h2 align="left">Simplicial Homology</h2>

      <p>
        Homology aims at detecting \(k\)-dimensional holes in a shape, \(k\)-holes for short.
        A \(k\)-hole is detected by collecting the \(k\)-simplices around it. So for example:

        <ul>
          <!-- <li>a $0$-hole is delimited by vertices in two different connected components and, thus, detects disconnections in the domain $\Sigma$.</li> -->
          <li>a 0-hole is delimited a vertex in a connected components and, thus, the presence of 0-holes detects disconnections in \(\Sigma\);</li>
          <li>a 1-hole is delimited by collections of edges around it, thus, detecting a loop;</li>
          <li>a 2-hole will be delimited by collections of triangles around it, thus, detecting a void, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <div class="lClass">
          The interactive example presents only two types of holes over the three that we can find on a 2-simplicial complex. In particular it has
          two <a onmouseover="overFunction2(0)" onmouseout="overFunction2(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>0-holes</b></font></a>, since it is formed by two
          components

          and one
          <a onmouseover="overFunction2(1)" onmouseout="overFunction2(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>1-hole</b></font></a>.
      </div>

        <div id="simplComplHoles" align="center"> </div>
        <script src="scripts/simplicialHoles.js"></script>

        <!-- There are possibly many combinations of simplices around a single hole. This motivates the need of the following algebraic machinary. -->

        <p>In the following, we describe the algebraic formulation that allows for detecting holes. For each notion introduced, we will furnish the
        corresponding geometrical example on our interactive figure.</p>

        <p>The \(k\)-<b><em>chain</em></b> is the basic element we are going to consider.
          A \(k\)-chain is a formal sum of \(k\)-simplices on \(\Sigma_k\).

          The face relation among simplices induces a notion of boundary for \(k\)-chains.
          The <b><em>boundary map</em></b> \(\partial_k:C_k(\Sigma)\longrightarrow C_{k-1}(\Sigma)\) is defined, over each simplex \(\sigma=v_0\cdots v_k\), by
          $$
          \partial_k(\sigma):=\hat{\sigma}_0+\dots+\hat{\sigma}_k, \qquad  \quad \mbox{ for } i=0,\dots,k
          $$
          where \(\hat{\sigma}_i\) is the convex hull of all vertices of \(\sigma\) but \(v_i\).
          Then, \(\partial_k\) is extended to all \(k\)-chains by linearity and by removing each pair of simplices appearing twice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given a \(k\)-chain \(c\), its \((k-1)\)-<b><em>boundary</em></b> is \(\partial_k(c)\) and the the image of the map \(\partial_k\) is denoted by \(B_{k-1}(\Sigma)\).
        </p>

        <p>
          Among all the possible chains on a simplicial complex, we want to recognize a specific type of chains.
          A \(k\)-<b><em>cycle</b></em> is a \(k\)-chain \(c\) such that \(\partial_k(c)=0\). The kernel of \(\partial_k\) is denoted by \(Z_k(\Sigma)\).
        </p>

        <div class="lClass">
          <p>In the following example, we can study different types of chains and boundaries. Lets consider the
          <a onmouseover="overFunction3(0)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>1-chain</b></font></a> composed by a set of edges.
          Its <a onmouseover="overFunction3(1)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>0-boundary</b></font></a> corresponds to the
          set of vertices that appears as a face of an odd number of edges.</p>

          <p>In this case, we have only one
          <a onmouseover="overFunction3(2)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>2-chain</b></font></a> composed by a single triangle
          and its <a onmouseover="overFunction3(3)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>1-boundary</b></font></a> is composed by
          all its three edges.</p>

          <p>Identifying the holes of an object means to discriminate between the cycles that are the boundary of some chain and those that are not.
          As we already know, the <a onmouseover="overFunction3(4)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>1-chain</b></font></a> around the triangle
          is a boundary, while the
          <a onmouseover="overFunction3(5)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>1-chain</b></font></a>
          around the hole is not. Notice that we may have multiple non-boundary
          <a onmouseover="overFunction3(6)" onmouseout="overFunction3(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>chains</b></font></a>
          representing the same hole.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="simplChains" align="center"> </div>
        <script src="scripts/chains.js"></script>


        <p>It can be easily checked that \(B_k(\Sigma)\subseteq Z_k(\Sigma)\) by noticing that,
        for each \((k+1)\)-simplex \(\sigma\), each simplex in \(\partial_k(\partial_{k+1}(\sigma))\) appears exactly an even number of times,
        thus giving always a null contribute.</p>

        <p>This allows us to define, the \(k\)<b><em>-homology space</em></b> of \(\Sigma\) as
          $$
            H_k(\Sigma):= \frac{Z_k(\Sigma)}{B_k(\Sigma)}
          $$
        </p>

        <p>
          The quotient over the \(k\)-boundaries avoids redundancies, thus letting all the possible \(k\)-chains around the same \(k\)-hole
          to fall in the same homology class.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any homology degree \(k\), it holds that \(H_k(\Sigma)\) is a finite dimensional vector space.
          This means that the \(k\)-homology of a simplicial complex admits a finite basis of different \(k\)-homology classes \(h_1,\dots,h_{\beta_k}\) entirely expressing \(H_k(\Sigma)\).

          In formulas,
          $$
            H_k(\Sigma)\cong \underbrace{\mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus\dots\oplus \mathbb{Z}_2}_{\beta_k \mbox{ copies of } \mathbb{Z}_2}
          $$
        <p>

        The integer \(\beta_k\) indicates a homological invariant, which is called the \(k\)-<b><em>Betti number</em></b>.
        Intuitively, \(\beta_k\) corresponds to the number of \(k\)-dimensional holes in the simplicial complex.

            <b>Theoretical basis.</b> Building the simplicial chains in the way we have described is formally referred as
            build the chains by taking coefficients over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\). This is a common practice when working with simplicial homology in real applications
            since, working with \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), makes calculations much easier.</p>
          <p>
            However, homology can be defined with coefficients in any Abelian group. The complete homological information uses \(\mathbb{Z}\)
            as coefficient group, which is able of dealing with the presence of torsion in a shape. It can be proven (see
            <a class="link" href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html"
            title="<em>Algebraic topology</em>, A. Hatcher, 2002.">[Hat02]</a>
            , Chapter X)
            that simplicial complexes embeddable in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) have no torsion and thus,
            their \(\mathbb{Z}\)-homology groups reduce to \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-homology.</p>
