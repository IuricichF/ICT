    <div class="intro">
      In the previous section, we have introduced the concept of simplicial complex and simplicial homology.
      As we have learned, simplicial homology describes the cycles present on a shape in a very precise way.
      However, is when we are studying multiple objects, all with the same number of cycles, that the limitation of simplicial
      homology appears. Homology is not sufficient for discriminating features within the same homology class. Persistent homology
      has been defined for this purpose. Instead of analyzing the single object, persistent homology aims at analyzing the evolution of
      such object under the effect of a filtering function. In this section, we are going to introduce the notions of filtration and persistent homology.

        <p>
          Let \(m\) be a natural number.
          A <b><em>filtering function</em></b> is a function \(f:\Sigma\longrightarrow \{1, \dots, m\}\) such that,
          for each \(k\)-simplex \(\sigma\) and each \(0\leq i\leq k\), it holds that \(f(\hat{\sigma}_i)\leq f(\sigma)\).
          The filtering function \(f\) induces a nested sequence of simplicial complexes called <b><em>filtration</em></b> and denoted by \(\Sigma^f\)
          $$
            \Sigma^f\quad :\quad \emptyset=:\Sigma^{0}\subseteq\dots\subseteq\Sigma^{m}=\Sigma
          $$
          where, for each \(0\leq p\leq m\), the simplicial subcomplex \(\Sigma^{p}\) is defined by
          $$
            \Sigma^{p}:=\{ \sigma\in\Sigma\ |\ f(\sigma)\leq p \}
          $$

        <h2 >Persistent homology</h2>

        <p>
          The main goal of persistent homology consists in studying the filtration and, in particular, tracking the homologies that appear and disapper.
          Let us choose two parameters \(p\leq q\) of the filtration and a homology degree \(k\).

          Since the filtration has nested complexes, we will have that

            $$Z_k(\Sigma^{p})\subseteq Z_k(\Sigma^{q})$$

          and

            $$B_k(\Sigma^{p})\subseteq B_k(\Sigma^{q})$$

          Moreover, we get induced a linear map \(i_k^{p,q}:H_k(\Sigma^{p})\longrightarrow H_k(\Sigma^{q})\)
          between the two different homology spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the filtration \(\Sigma^f\), the \((p,q)\)<b><em>-persistent</em></b> \(k\)-<b><em>homology space</em></b> is defined by
            $$
              H^{p,q}_k(\Sigma^f):=\mbox{Im}(i_k^{p,q})
            $$

            That is, \(H^{p,q}_k(\Sigma^f)\) is the subspace of \(H_k(\Sigma^{q})\) of the homology classes already born at parameter \(p\) which
            persist at parameter \(q\).
         </p>
         <p>
           A <b><em>persistence class</em></b> for a filtration \(\Sigma^f\) is a homology class \(h\) belonging to \(H_k(\Sigma^p)\)
           for at least one parameter \(p\). We associate \(h\) with the smallest parameter \(p_h\) where it exists in the filtration and we say that \(h\)
            is <em><b>born</b></em> at level \(p_h\).
         </p>
         <p>
           By increasing parameter \(p\), the class \(h\) cannot split into two different classes since the complexes in \(\Sigma^f\) are nested.
           However, \(h\) can possibly become equivalent to another class \(h'\) at same greater parameter in case some boundary between the two classes enters the filtration.
         </p>
         <p>
           When \(h\) merges to \(h'\) at parameter \(q\), we say that the homology class <em><b>dies</b></em> at level \(q_h\).
           Generally, we assume that the persistence class dying is the younger one.
           In case \(p_h=p_{h'}\), both choices are allowed as long as one class dies and the other survives.
           When a class \(h\) never dies, we assign \(q_h=\infty\).
         </p>

         <div class="lClass">
           Visiting the filtration:

           <ul>
             <li>at level 1, we see that <font color="006600"><b>three classes</b></font> of 0-homology born;</li>
             <li>at level 2, the <font color="b30000"><b>red class</b></font> dies merging with another one;</li>
             <li>at level 3, no other classes die but a non-boundary <font color="006600"><b>1-cycle</b></font> born and it will never die.</li>
           </ul>

           Notice that the survived classes correspond to the homology of the final object.

         <h2 >Visualizing the persistence classes</h2>

        <p>
          Persistent homology features are represented by the <b><em>\(k\)-persistence diagram</em></b> Dgm\(_k(\Sigma^f)\).

          The elements in Dgm\(_k(\Sigma^{f})\) are all the <b><em>persistence pairs</em></b> \((p_h,q_h)\) in \(\{0, \dots, m\}\times(\{0, \dots, m\}\cup\infty)\) for each persistence class \(h\) of homology degree \(k\) in the filtration \(\Sigma^f\).
        </p>

        <p>
          Formally speaking, the persistent diagram is not a proper set since each element \((p,q)\) in Dgm\(_k(\Sigma^f)\) can possibly appears many times.

          The <b><em>multiplicity</em></b> of a persistence pair \((p,q)\) is the number of different persistence classes \(h\) such that \((p_h,q_h)=(p,q)\).
          Hence, the persistence diagram is a <b><em>multiset</em></b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case \(q_h=\infty\), the class \(h\) is called <b><em>essential</em></b> since, in fact, it is part of the homology of \(\Sigma\).
          For non-essential classes \(h\), the <b><em>persistence</b></em> is its own life duration, that is \(p_h-q_h\).
          We visualize the persistence of a class in the persistence diagram as the distance of its respective point \((p_h,q_h)\)
          from the diagonal \(\Delta:=\{ (p,q)\in\{0, \dots, m\}\times\{0, \dots, m\} \ |\ p=q \}\) in the \(\infty\)-norm.
        </p>
        <div class="lClass">
          In the following figure, the graph of Dgm\(_0(\Sigma^f)\) is shown on the left.
          It has two different persistence pairs.
          The <a onmouseover="selectPoint(0)" onmouseout="selectPoint(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>lower</b></font></a>
          one has multiplicity 1 and persistence equal to 1.
          The <a onmouseover="selectPoint(1)" onmouseout="selectPoint(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>upper</b></font></a>
          instead has multiplicity 2 and it is essential.
          Notice that we are indicating essential persistence pairs with an y value equal to 4, since for that value of the filtering function \(\Sigma^4\) is already equal to \(\Sigma\).

          On the right Dgm\(_1(\Sigma^f)\) is shown. It has only <a onmouseover="selectPoint(2)" onmouseout="selectPoint(-1)"><font color="002db3"><b>one</b></font></a> essential persistence pair whose persistence is 1.

               ">Barcodes</a>
              represent a different but equally intuitive way for visualizing peristence pairs.
              Properly, a barcode is a graphical representation of the persistent homology of a filtered simplicial complex as a collection
              of horizontal line segments obtained by considering each persistence pair \((p,q)\) as an interval.</p>

             <p>Recently, a novel representation for the visualization of persistence pairs, called persistence landscape,
             has been introduced. A

             ">persistence landscape</a>
              is a representation halfway between the persistence diagram and the barcode.
             It can be roughly considered as a horizontal version of the persistence diagram and it has been studied for better combining
             topological data analysis with statistics and machine learning.</p>
